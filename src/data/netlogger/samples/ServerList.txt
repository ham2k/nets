# ServerList Version 2
#
# This is the current list of NetLogger servers. The server name and
# whether or not the server is public or for development only, is configured
# on the server.
#
# WARNING: There should be no need to edit this file locally, but if you
#          do, NetLogger will reject it due to a checksum mismatch. Replace
#          the value for the FileCheckSum variable with "override". This will
#          override file corruption protection. Note that the checksum is an
#          MD5 checksum, but only of non comment lines, with leading and
#          trailing white space removed (including CR's and NL's at the end
#          of each line). Also the line containing the FileCheckSum variable
#          is not used in the checksum computation. You could regenerate the
#          checksum, but it can be a little complicated.
